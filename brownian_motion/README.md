# Brownian Motion

This is a simple bot that simulates a 2D Brownian motion. It is written in Python and uses the pygame library.

## Get started

To set up, create a virtual environment and install packages with these commands:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After that, just run the `main.py` file:

```bash
python main.py
```

You should see a window with a circle moving around. The circle will rotate randomly when it collides with the walls.
