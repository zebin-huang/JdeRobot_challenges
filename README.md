# JdeRobot GSOC-2024 Challenges Solutions

This repository contains the solutions to the JdeRobot GSOC-2024 challenges.

## Modules

The repository is organized into several modules:

- `brownian_motion`: This module simulates a 2D Brownian motion. It is written in Python and uses the pygame library.

- `robotics-academy-challenge`: Contains the solutions and exercises for the Robotics Academy challenges.

- `ros_navigation`: This module includes implementations for basic robot navigation using ROS2.

- `task_manage_app`: This is a task management application built using React. It allows users to create and delete tasks, as well as set deadlines and categories for tasks. In addition, it will remind users of tasks that are about to expire but have not been completed. All data is saved locally.

## Getting Started

To get started with these modules, clone the repository and build each module as per the instructions within their respective directories.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zebin-huang/JdeRobot_challenges.git
cd JdeRobot_challenges/<module_name>
